Language: Python 3.xx

Usage:
python seq_align.py or python3 seq_align.py


The program aligns two given sequences based on the gap score and substitution matrix provided. In the case of
multiple possible alignments, the program uses dfs to find the alingnment with the maximum score. 

- The two sequences are required to be in separate files, and the file names are to be provided when prompted.
- Enter the the name of the subscore matrix file when prompted.
- Verify if the substitution file contains a non-comma-delimted PAM-n matrix
- Enter the gap score along with a "-" when prompted. ex: -5

The program will output the OPT matrix, the score of the optimal alignment, and the optimal alignment itself.
The program can be terminated with keyboard interrupt. Ctrl+C
